## ðŸŽ™ Voice Command Instructions
The simulator supports **voice-triggered commands** for faster and more realistic ADAFCO operations.

1. **Enable Microphone Access**
   - On first launch, click the **ðŸŽ¤ Dictate** button at the bottom-left of the screen.
   - Grant microphone permission when prompted by your browser.

2. **Speaking Commands**
   - Use standard ADAFCO phraseology:
   - Hold CRTL and make calls to the TD C/S "GUARDIAN" from the BCC C/S "BIGFOOT"
     - `"Cover Track [ID]"`
     - `"Cover Group Bullseye [bearing/distance]"`
     - `"Engage Track [ID]"` or `"Engage Group Bullseye [bearing/distance]"`
     - `"Hold Fire Track [ID]"`
     - `"SL, ADAFCO, Request Redwood Hot [NW/NE/SW/SE] Quadrant"`

3. **Best Practices**
   - Speak clearly and at a steady pace.
   - Use a noise-free environment for best recognition.

   - iOS Safari may require the first tap anywhere on the page to enable audio/voice features.
